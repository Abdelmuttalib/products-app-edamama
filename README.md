# edamama test products app

## Simple and Minimal Products app
### technologies used: Angular, Tailwindcss, Nodejs, Expressjs, MongoDB

##### *note: due to MongoDB setup not being live immediately, it was hard to sync it especially at last minutes of submission. But I have produced the requirements with a tool 'json-server' just for the mean time while the MongoDB database wasn't up yet and couldn't with directly on development period.

#### The logic for the backend is fully implemented and ready, but will only work once the MongoDB database is up, which takes a little bit long sometimes to be up and allow for connections.



## How to run project (example without the backend MongoDB)

### 1. clone the project
### 2. open the terminal at the root and then navigate to the frontend folder
### 3. inside the frontend folder, run `npm install` to install dependencies, then run `ng server` and on another terminal window of same directory run `npm run server`
#### The app should be working on localhost:4200


## How to run project (with the backend and MongoDB)
### 1. clone the project
### 2. open the terminal at the root, and while on the root of the project run `npm install` to install dependencies, then you can run `npm run server` to start the backend
### 3. navigate to the fronend folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies, then open a terminal window on that directory, and then you can run `ng server`
#### The app should be working on localhost:4200
